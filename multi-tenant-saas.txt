What We Are Building (Product Vision)

A platform where:

Companies create an organization workspace

Employees join the company

Each employee has a role (admin, manager, member)

Data of Company A is completely invisible to Company B

Subscription plans limit usage (e.g., max users, max projects)

Admin dashboard shows analytics

Example use case:

A startup uses your app to manage internal tasks/projects
Another startup signs up → they should never see first startup’s data

This is the core idea of SaaS multi-tenancy.

Learning Roadmap (Strict Order)

We follow industry architecture order — not tutorial order.

PHASE 1 — Authentication & Identity Model (Foundation)

Without this → multi-tenant is impossible.

You Must Master

JWT authentication deeply

Sessions vs Tokens

Password hashing

Login flows

Refresh tokens

Authorization vs Authentication (very important)

What You Will Build

A standalone authentication service:

Signup

Login

Protected route

Access token + refresh token

Logout (invalidate refresh token)

Concepts You Must Understand (Important)

You must be able to answer these:

Why JWT should be short lived?

Why refresh tokens stored in DB?

Why password is never decryptable?

Why we never trust frontend role?

Exercises (Do before moving ahead)

Exercise 1
Create middleware:

req.user = decodedUserFromToken


and protect route /profile

Exercise 2
Implement refresh token rotation:

Old refresh token becomes invalid after use

Exercise 3
Force logout all devices

(Hint: tokenVersion in DB)

When you complete this → you are already above average backend dev.

PHASE 2 — Multi-Tenant Database Design (Most Important Phase)

This is the REAL core of the project.

You now learn how companies exist in software.

Key Idea

Every record belongs to a tenant.

We introduce a new entity:

Organization (Tenant)


Every user belongs to exactly one organization.

Data Model You Will Learn

User is NOT global anymore.

Instead:

User
 └── belongs to Organization


All future data will include:

organizationId

Critical Concept: Data Leakage

The worst SaaS bug:

User from Company A can see Company B data

Your entire backend design exists to prevent this.

Exercises

Exercise 4 — Schema Design

Design collections:

organizations

users

invitations

Draw relationship diagram on paper first.

Exercise 5 — Tenant Middleware

Create middleware:

req.tenantId


derived from logged in user

Then modify:

Project.find()


to automatically become:

Project.find({ organizationId: req.tenantId })


No controller should manually filter tenant.

This is INDUSTRY PRACTICE.

PHASE 3 — RBAC (Role Based Access Control)

Now we stop users doing admin actions.

You Will Learn

Difference between:

Concept	Meaning
Authentication	Who are you
Authorization	What you can do
Roles

Owner

Admin

Member

Implementation Idea

Permission middleware:

allowRoles("ADMIN", "OWNER")

Exercises

Exercise 6
Prevent members from deleting projects

Exercise 7
Only owner can upgrade subscription

PHASE 4 — Subscription & Usage Metering

Now we simulate real SaaS revenue model.

Concepts

Hardest backend concepts in this project:

Quotas

Plan enforcement

Feature gating

Example:

Free Plan:

max 3 users

max 5 projects

Pro Plan:

unlimited users

analytics enabled

Exercises

Exercise 8
Block creating 6th project on free plan

Exercise 9
Upgrade plan → restrictions disappear instantly

PHASE 5 — Frontend (Your Strength Area)

Now your frontend skills shine.

You will implement:

Workspace switcher

Invite users modal

Admin panel

Analytics dashboard

Dark/light theme engine

We will implement a real theme system (not CSS toggle hack):

CSS Variables + Context + Persistent preference

PHASE 6 — Deployment (Most Students Skip — Recruiters Notice)

You will learn:

Backend → Render / Railway / VPS

Frontend → Vercel

MongoDB Atlas production config

Environment separation

Cookie security in production

CORS production handling

Tech Stack We Will Use

MERN + Production additions:

Express

MongoDB

JWT + Refresh tokens

Socket ready architecture (future extendable)

Redis (optional bonus)

Tailwind + Custom CSS variables for theme system
